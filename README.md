**Our Vision**
The After Initiative is a foundation created by four computer science students with the intention to discover how the availability of Texas financial and educational resources for higher education will impact low-income Texas high school graduates seeking to attend college as a computer science major by 2030. We have developed a website that provides information on FAFSA, scholarships, and other learning resources. We aim to improve the college readiness, both financially and academically, for Texas high school graduates intending to enroll in a Texas public university to major in computer science.


Through the Signature Experience project for the Academic Inquiry & Scholarship course at The University of Texas at San Antonio, The After Initiative was established in November 2022. This project was researched with the intention to better understand if the increased availability information will positively impact graduating Texas high school students. By 2030, we anticipate that our website's impact will increase the confidence concerning college enrollment of low-income graduating Texas high school students.


**How it Works**


Our website has been designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We provide resources on Financial Aid, Scholarships, Learning Resources, and more. Students can click the category you are interested in on the website header to receive more information. We provide this information for free in an effort to improve the rate of graduating Texas high school students entering college by 2023.


**Info**


It is estimated that a large number of Texas graduating seniors do not consider attending college because of the following factors: 30.6% were undecided, 29.4% enrolled in the workforce, 21.2% reported to have other plans, and 18.8% intended to join the military (Hutchins, Arshavsky, Edmunds, et al., 2018).

In light of this, The After Initiative focuses on:


-Alleviating financial hardship for students who wish to attend college
-Addressing/Accommodating career indecision by linking resources to career assessments
-Offering Computer Science resources to positively influence students' academic success and college advancement
