  <h1 style = "text-align: center;color:green;">What is a Scholarship?</h1>

  
  <p style = "text-align: center;margin: 5px 50px 10px 50px;"> A scholarship is a financial award typically awarded to students for academic merit. This is a great way to pay for college, as you do not have to pay any of the money back. There are many common misconceptions about how to qualify for, apply for, and receive scholarships, but the information below will clear up any uncertainty.</p>

  <br> </br>

  <h1 style = "text-align: center;color:green;">Who can apply for a scholarship?</h1>

    <p style = "text-align: center;margin: 5px 50px 10px 50px;"> Any student can apply for a scholarship. The main concern is which scholarships you can apply for. Many scholarships have various conditions and prerequisites that may cater to certain students. Some common requirements often include gender, ethnicity, income, citizenship, intended major, and location. Many scholarships also provide characteristics that will provide students with the best possible chances of receiving the scholarship. Many of these factors include GPA, course rigor, extracurriculars, individual grades, leadership, and volunteer work.
</p>

  <br> </br>

  <h1 style = "text-align: center;color:green;">What if I have bad grades?</h1>
  
      <p style = "text-align: center;margin: 5px 50px 10px 50px;"> While grades do play a vital factor in your qualification for scholarships, they are not the only factor that matters. Rather than hurting your chances with low grades, it is best to maintain your GPA to no lower than 2.5. </p>

    <br> </br>

  <h1 style = "text-align: center;color:green;">What if my family has a high income?</h1>
  
      <p style = "text-align: center;margin: 5px 50px 10px 50px;"> Many scholarships do cater to students coming from families with lower incomes, but there are still many scholarships out there that do not take financial need into account. Discovering these scholarships is just a matter of researching. </p>
